}
    # 'u' was mapped to Cysteine because the atomic symbol for the element sulfur, which is found in cysteine, is 'S', and 'u' and 's' are neighbors in the English alphabet.
    # 'v' and 'w' were both mapped to Valine. They are next to each other in the alphabet and have similar sounds, which might make this mapping easier to remember.
    # 'x' and 'y' were both mapped to Tyrosine. The reason for this is that 'x' is often used to represent unknowns or variables, and 'y' often represents a second variable. This could be a mnemonic to remember this mapping.
    # 'z' was mapped to Serine, since 'z' and 's' have similar sounds, making this mapping somewhat intuitive.

It is a dark and windy night. Your hand are stuffed into your trenchcoat pockets as leaves whip around your fedora. After stepping out of the cemetery, you look up into the sullen sky. *Things used to be different.* You think back to the days of long automobiles with hard tops, the rollerskating drive throughs with smiling blond curls, children laughing white teeth gasoline stations. 

O the laughs and good joys of Ye Olde days! Now look where we are nowâ€¦ not a pittance in our pockets. Where are our flying cars? Where is the children? We need to go back, lang lang agone, and take them back â€” our values!! 

If only we had a way to re-member old Freedom, Lady Liberty, Sir Locke. Do we need God, or surgery? Science it is! Yes, science indeed. We will hold the old Amendments in our hands like babes just-born. Computers, yes, the genie goblins in the computers will spit them out, out! 

*Are you tired of the ordinary, craving something extraordinary that embodies your deep love for this great nation? Stand out with Patriot Proteins, 3D printed plastic models of proteins that aren't just scientifically fascinating, but culturally resonant. Each one is a tribute to our cherished heritage, encoding messages from the bedrock of American thought - the Federalist Papers, the Second Amendment, and more.*

YES

*In the realm of home or office decor, these aren't just unique items, they're talking points. Stimulate thought-provoking conversations about the foundations of our nation's values, all emanating from an encoded protein model that's as much a testament to our advancements in technology as it is to our rich history.
Patriot Proteins, where past and present, science and patriotism come together to create something truly special. Show your American pride and spirit with this remarkable addition to your space!*

YES PLEASE

*Weâ€™ve collected all your favorite patriotic texts and done the hard work of translating it to amino acids and protein sequences so that you can admire the structure from the comfort of your living room.*

ILL TAKE IT. ILL TAKE ALL OF IT NOW"""



instructions = """## The Way
1. Take input text, and translate English letters into amino acids using the following mapping:

|   Key   | Value |     Name      |
|:-------:|:-----:|:-------------:|
|    a    |   A   |    Alanine    |
|    b    |   R   |   Arginine    |
|    c    |   K   |    Lysine     |
|    d    |   D   | Aspartic Acid |
|    e    |   E   | Glutamic Acid |
|    f    |   F   | Phenylalanine |
| ...     |  ...  |    ...        |
|    y    |   Y   |   Tyrosine    |
|    z    |   S   |    Serine     |


2. Using [ESMFold](https://github.com/facebookresearch/esm), a sequence-to-structure transformer, predict the folding of the amino acids into a protein. 
3. Visualize the resulting protein in PyMol. It is now in a PDB file.
4. Convert the PDB to an STL file using Connolly molecular surface estimation, point reduction, format conversion. A library will handle this for you
5. Load the STL file into an Ultimaker S5 (or similar) and print.
6. Behold the great freedom of the Patriot Protein in the palm of your hand

*Note: the beginning batch of the Patriot Proteins are still in production. You may pre-order one now, and will be refunded in the event of a nuclear war, plague, rogue autonomous system, or any other event that prevents the manufacture of the 3D models within two months.*"""
