These aren't just 3D printed plastic models of proteins, but cultural touchstones that encode messages from our American heritage, including the Federalist Papers and the Second Amendment. As decor, they ignite discussions about our national values, serving as a testament to our technological advancements and rich history. With Patriot Proteins, history and science combine to celebrate your American spirit in a truly distinctive way.")

}
    # 'u' was mapped to Cysteine because the atomic symbol for the element sulfur, which is found in cysteine, is 'S', and 'u' and 's' are neighbors in the English alphabet.
    # 'v' and 'w' were both mapped to Valine. They are next to each other in the alphabet and have similar sounds, which might make this mapping easier to remember.
    # 'x' and 'y' were both mapped to Tyrosine. The reason for this is that 'x' is often used to represent unknowns or variables, and 'y' often represents a second variable. This could be a mnemonic to remember this mapping.
    # 'z' was mapped to Serine, since 'z' and 's' have similar sounds, making this mapping somewhat intuitive.
